# My C Learning Journey  

Welcome to my C learning repository! üñ•Ô∏è  

This repository contains all the C exercises I‚Äôve solved so far as part of my learning journey. The problems range from basic concepts to more complex algorithms, and I continue to update it as I progress.

### üîπ What You‚Äôll Find Here:  
- Solutions to C programming exercises  
- Step-by-step problem-solving  
- Experimentation with different C concepts and techniques  

### üöÄ Purpose:  
This repository serves as a personal archive of my C programming progress. It also aims to be a reference for anyone learning C programming. Feel free to explore the code, use it for reference, or improve upon it!

### üìù Exercise List

1. **Rectangle Area and Perimeter**  
   Given the base and height of a rectangle, calculate its area and perimeter.  

2. **Square Area and Perimeter**  
   Given the side length of a square, calculate its area and perimeter.  

3. **Circle Area and Perimeter**  
   Given the radius of a circle, calculate its area and perimeter.  

4. **Triangle Perimeter**  
   Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle, calculate its perimeter.  

5. **Successor of an Integer**  
   Read an integer and display its successor.  

6. **Quotient and Remainder**  
   Read two integers and display the quotient and remainder of their division.  

7. **Age in Days to Years, Months, and Days**  
   Given a person‚Äôs age in days, convert and display it in years, months, and days.  

8. **Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion**  
   Convert a given temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula: C = 5/9 * (F ‚Äì 32).  

9. **Volume of a Oil Can**  
   Calculate the volume of an oil can given its radius and height.  

10. **Convert Integer to Binary**  
    Convert a given integer (less than 32) to its binary representation.  

11. **Student‚Äôs Semester Grade**  
    Calculate the semester grade of a student, which is the arithmetic mean of two bimester grades. Each bimester grade is the average of two exam grades.  

12. **Speed Conversion from m/s to km/h**  
    Convert a given speed from meters per second (m/s) to kilometers per hour (km/h) by multiplying the value by 3.6.  

13. **Equivalent Resistance in a Circuit**  
    Calculate the equivalent resistance of a circuit with two resistors (R1 and R2) in parallel, followed by another resistor (R3) in series.  

14. **Traffic Light Synchronization**  
    In a city, traffic lights are synchronized so that vehicles encounter open lights as they drive. Given the distance to the next traffic light, the speed limit, and the car's acceleration, calculate when the next light should open (it should open 3s before the car reach it's point)
